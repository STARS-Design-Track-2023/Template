# Guidelines for Contributing

Team members should...
- create a branch off the main repo for their work
- consistently commit their work with descriptive names
- push their work often to keep the repo up to date
- consult and ping others using issues when updating others' work
- merge from the main branch when they are ready to upload new work
- open a pull request on the main branch rather than pushing or merging
- make a descriptive pull request and mention any relevant members or issues
- wait for their TA to test and approve their pull request

All guidelines are subject to change according to your TA
